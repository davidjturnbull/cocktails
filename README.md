### Description

Cocktails is a list of of some popular classic and modern classics cocktail recipes presented (in metric units) in a quick-to-read 'spec sheet' format similar to those used by bartenders. The list comes from a similar list I made when I trained bartenders on cocktails and spirits in London, UK.

I realise that different bars/bartenders have their own ways of making drinks that may differ from what I have used, however I’ve tried to give versions of the cocktails that I feel work well internationally  – recipes are a guide, not a book of law! Also, glassware is kept relatively simple (similar to what you would expect in a good home bar without needing to get too exotic).
